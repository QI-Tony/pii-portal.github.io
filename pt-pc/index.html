              One of the largest companies in the world, Uber, discovered they
              were hacked in mid-September after the hacker announced in the
              companies Slack organization "I am a hacker and Uber has suffered
              a data breach". This caused the company to shut down its internal
              messaging service and engineering systems in order to get to the
              bottom of the incident.

              Health insurer MediBank revealed on 10/25/2022 that almost 10
              million of their customers' data had been exposed to a hacker. The
              Australian health insurer said the personal information that could
              have been obtained includes name, address, date of birth, and even
              insurance card numbers.

              In April 2022, Cash App acknowledged that a former employee had
              breached its servers. The hacker clearly had a significant axe to
              grind with the business. The hack involved customer names, stock
              trading information, account numbers and portfolio values,
              alongside loads of other sensitive financial information. The
              company contacted more than eight million customers to tell them
              about the incident.
